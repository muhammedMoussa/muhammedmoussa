Hello, this is a software developer currently focused on client-side delivery and integration.
I am experienced in various project scales and industries. also, collaborate with different teams and cultures from different countries.
Regardless of the client-side tech stack `"*.js"`, and the platform (Web, Mobile, PWA...) the main goal is to deliver reusable, high-quality, user-friendly, and maintainable software.

I am playing software and am currently client-side focused, Here I usually play around with techs by docs or tutorials follow-up, and sometimes build complete/real projects. here a fast list of some inside playing.
